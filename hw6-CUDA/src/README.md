# CS 148 - Summer 2017

The starter code for all assignments will live within this repository!
If you find a bug in any of the starter code we post here, we'll award you extra credit, so hunt away, let us know, and we'll push new changes here as necessary.

## Getting started:

Clone the repository using the command:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/schazers/cs148-student-repo.git

Good luck! Looking forward to a fun quarter.
